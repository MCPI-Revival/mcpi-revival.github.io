A lot has happened since the MCPI-Revival project was founded in mid-2020. This project was founded to revive an abandoned version of Minecraft, and now our efforts are starting to bear fruit. Here is a status update on our current and upcoming projects!

## New Logo!
A contest was held from ``2021-1-15 01:00 UTC`` to ``2021-1-17 01:00 UTC`` to pick a new logo for the MCPI-Revival project. Ultimately, ``Option #2`` emerged victorious!

One of the runnerups, ``Option #4`` was chosen to become the new logo for MCPIL as well.
