A lot has happened since the MCPI-Revival project was founded in mid-2020. This project was founded to revive an abandoned version of Minecraft, and now our efforts are starting to bear fruit. Here is a status update on our current and upcoming projects!

## New Logo!
A contest was held (from ``2021-1-15 01:00 UTC`` to ``2021-1-17 01:00 UTC``) to pick a new logo for the MCPI-Revival project. Ultimately, ``Option #2`` emerged victorious!

One of the runnerups, ``Option #4``, was chosen to become the new logo for MCPIL as well.

## MCPIL
The original MCPIL has been discontinued for various reasons. The only usable mod was ModPi and while attempts were made to integrate MCPI-Docker, they were very unstable. So, the decision was made to discontinue the original MCPIL and rewrite it from scratch as MCPIL-R (or MCPIL - Rebooted).

MCPIL-R is a launcher for MCPI-Docker with the ability to save your configuration. It also has integration with the multiplayer proxy just like the original. However, it currently lacks support for MCPI-Central and a few other features from the original. Because it uses MCPI-Docker it can also run on devces other than the Raspberry Pi as well.

## Website News
The entire website now uses a custom Jekyll theme and has been migrated to Markdown! This makes the theming more consistent and will make it easier for us to add more pages (like this one).
