## jmcpil and gmcpil

moving on from just plain mcpil, jmcpil and gmcpil are two diffrent versions of mcpi reborn. jmcpil has a nicer UI however since it is written in java it can impact performance so we recommended to use it on raspberry pi 4s so it does not impact your performance. gmcpil on the other hand is written in c++ which means it will run faster overall, so if you just want speed or have an older pi, gmcpil is your best bet.
