## What is Minecraft Pi?

It's a fork (modification) of an old version of Minecraft Pocket Edition (Alpha v0.6.1), ported to the Raspberry Pi.

## How do I get it?

Method A: Official AppImages
Download an AppImage from https://jenkins.thebrokenrail.com/job/minecraft-pi-reborn/job/master. Instructions for running the AppImage can be found at https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html#ref-how-to-run-appimage.

Method B: Official Flatpak
Download the Flatpak from https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.thebrokenrail.MCPIReborn.

Method C (Raspberry Pi OS ARM Only): Pi-Apps
Install from https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps, it is listed as Minecraft Pi (Modded). 

## What extra features does MCPI have?

Minecraft: Pi Edition comes with a built-in scripting API, with clients in multiple languages: Python ([mcpi](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi), [Picraft](https://picraft.readthedocs.io/)), [JavaScript](https://github.com/mdnorman/node-mcpi), Java and many more.

## Modding
TL;DR: Do your own research on the topic(s).

1. How do you edit .so files?
You don't. There is no such thing as ".so files".
2. Can you add sprinting?
No, because there's no hunger system (see below), but you can use the speed hack pinned in general.
3. Can you add a hunger system?
No.
4. Can you add more blocks to the creative inventory?
Only if they already exist (see below; most blocks and items are already in the creative inventory).
5. Can you add new blocks?
No.
6. Can the API be used on MCPE 0.6.1?
No, the API was added as an exclusive feature to MCPI, after its port from PE 0.6.1.

## How is it related to MCPE?

Minecraft: Pi Edition is related to Minecraft: Pocket Edition, because the first is a "modified" and ported version of the second one, but they are **not** the same. For example, MCPI by default doesn't have the Survival mode enabled.
