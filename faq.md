## What is Minecraft Pi?

It's a fork (modification) of an old version of Minecraft Pocket Edition (Alpha v0.6.1), ported to the Raspberry Pi.

## Can I play it?

MCPI-Reborn, a core project, officially supports at least Debian/Raspbian Buster or Ubuntu 20.04. While it may work on other operating systems, it is not officially supported.

## How do I get it?

### Option A: Pi-Apps (Raspberry Pi Only)

### Option B: Manual Installation

## What extra features does MCPI have?

Minecraft: Pi Edition comes with a built-in scripting API, with clients in multiple languages: Python ([mcpi](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi), [Picraft](https://picraft.readthedocs.io/)), [JavaScript](https://github.com/mdnorman/node-mcpi), Java and many more.

## How is it related to MCPE?

Minecraft: Pi Edition is related to Minecraft: Pocket Edition, because the first is a "modified" and ported version of the second one, but they are **not** the same. For example, MCPI by default doesn't have the Survival mode enabled.
