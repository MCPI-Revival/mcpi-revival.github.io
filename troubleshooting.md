_**Help!**_ I can't...

 + **Decide which launcher to use** - Currently this is just personal preference,
   so give them both a try and see which one you like more!
 + **Install MCPI under Windows** - Please keep in mind that there's no
   official Windows support, but MCPI-Reborn _happens to work_ under WSL2
   and GWSL/WSLg. If you get an error like `Unable To Open Maximum Pipe
   Size File`, it means you're still using WSL1, please try upgrading to
   WSL2 as detailed in Microsoft's [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
