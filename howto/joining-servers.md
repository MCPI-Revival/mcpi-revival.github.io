First of all, you will need to get the IP and the port of the server. We host a curated list of good servers [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/servers.html). Both methods requires Python 3.7 or higher.

## Using The Launcher
Joining servers has never been so easy!
The process is identical on both, gMCPIL and jMCPIL. 
Go to the servers tab, and add the server IPs. Make a new line to add a new one. If the port is needed, use this format: `ip:port`. For example, `thebrokenrail.com:19132`.

## Manually
MCPI-Reborn features an inbuilt proxy for connecting to servers. The format that should be used is the same as for the launcher. The launchers save the server list to `~/.minecraft/servers.txt`. You can edit it manually to change server IPs without a launcher.
